<p>-Oh my God! It is so dirty inside! If I had a broom I would broom this entire floor!</p>
<p>-Ok. Let's find the administration office.</p>
<p>You found the administration office on the second floor.</p>
<p>Inside you met a dead body of a doctor. And near his leg you noticed a package of medicine.</p>
<p>Will you take it or do you feel disgusted to touch it?</p>
