<p>You left the store with a "Snickers" that you noticed near the exit because you are so hungry.</p>

<p>-Ok, lets walk a little bit.</p>
<p>So scary and strange...</p>
<p>Streets are completely empty...</p>
<p>-I am not afraid. My father taught me to be brave!</p>
<p>Where is my mobile? Why don't I have it?</p>
<p>Oh... No problem, maybe I will meet somebody.</p>

<p>Then you noticed that street is narrowing... </p>
<p>And you heard the rumbling of the stomach...</p>
<p>-Let's eat the Sneakers! Good opportunity... No one will beg...</p>
<p>You opened a package and bite a little bit...</p>
<p>A heart-rending roar came from a nearby house...</p>
<p>-It was not my stomach... What is that?</p>
<p>And you saw 3 zombies living the house!</p>
<p>How can I protect me?</p>
